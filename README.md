======================================<C++>======================================

I am a C++ developer. I will post random C++ projects I have whenever I have time
and whenever I feel like they're ready to be published. This doesn't mean I'll
post everything though. Please enjoy the projects I publish and feel free to use
them yourself. Please do not skid this code and publish it as being your own, as
it'll only make you look stupid once people ask you how something works. Thanks.
